# Shortest-Path-Finder-in-a-2D-Grid-with-Obstacles-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
his project implements a Python-based shortest path finder in a 2D grid environment using Dijkstra's Algorithm. It calculates the optimal path between two points while avoiding obstacles, making it useful for applications like robotics, game development, and navigation systems.
